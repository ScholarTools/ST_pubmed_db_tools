# pubmed_database
Tools for getting your own Pubmed Database up and running. This project has yet to really start.

The National Library of Medicine licenses out the Pubmed database to people. After filling out an application you are provided with access to files (xml?) which can be used to populate a database. You can always query Pubmed directly, but this would allow quicker data fetches and more specialized queries.
